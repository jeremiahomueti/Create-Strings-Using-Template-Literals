//Create strings using template literals!!

const person =
{
    name: "Zodiac Hasbro", 
    age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!  
I am ${person.age} years old.`; // here's an example of a template literal (using back-tick. So my guess is that template literals often require the use of back-ticks.)

console.log(greeting);
